# Credit-One
Data Science with Python 2020

Guido Rossum, Senior Data Scientist, at Credit One asked us to begin a new data science project using Python. Over the past year Credit One has encountered an increase in the number of customers who have defaulted on loans they secured from various partners, and Credit One, as their credit scoring service, could risk losing business if the problem is not solved right away. The bottom line is Credit One needs a much better way to understand how much credit to allow someone to use. 

Credit One enlisted the help of our data science team to design and implement a creative empirically sound solution. It is very important that we understand from the start that this is not a typical data analytics problem as we have been given full authority to solve this problem with whatever tools and methods we need. With that in mind we elected to use Python and a few different libraries to do the heavy lifting for us. We'll be using a few main libraries for the bulk of our work, but will not limit ourselves to only using those - we will investigate other libraries that may contribute to the best solution.

We will define this problem within a framework before using Credit Oneâ€™s historical data in our own working environment and Python to attempt to solve the problem. 

In defining the problem within a data science framework we can understand the differences between what Credit One has previously done with data analytics and what we will do in this project with data science. To complete our work we will use our local programming environment to have access to the tools we need, before finally starting the analysis and solving this problem. A report on our experience and understanding of the problem will follow.
